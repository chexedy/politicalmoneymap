                    This project provides a visual and educational overview of publicly available political campaign finance data in the United States. It is designed to help users explore how corporate and organizational campaign funding intersects with elected offices at the federal level.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All information displayed on this site is derived from official government sources, primarily the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The data is presented in an accessible, map-based format to promote transparency and public understanding of campaign finance disclosures.

                    Users can interact with the map to explore campaign finance data by location and office. Clicking on a state reveals information about its U.S. Senators, while selecting a congressional district displays data for its Representative. Selecting the White House shows information related to the President and Vice President.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Each official is assigned a letter grade based on reported corporate and PAC campaign contributions, scaled relative to the power of their office. These scores are intended to provide context and comparison, not judgment.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Additional views allow users to explore contributing organizations and see how funding is distributed across offices and regions.
